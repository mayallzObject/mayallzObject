### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_I've recently graduated from Codaisseur Academy as a Fullstack Web Developer. I started to code because I want to use my problem-solving skills to create value for society and my family, as well as meet new friends and build cool stuff.
I am still new to coding, but I am open-minded and eager to learn. You can find more about me on my_ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivaylo-ivo-yankov/).
